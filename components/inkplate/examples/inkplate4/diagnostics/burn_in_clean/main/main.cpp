/**
 * @file        main.cpp
 * @author      Fran Fodor for Soldered
 * @brief       Burn-in cleaning utility for Soldered Inkplate 4TEMPERA.
 *
 * @details     Runs the built-in burn-in cleaning sequence to remove ghosting and
 *              image retention from the e-paper panel. The screen is cycled through
 *              CLEAR_CYCLES full black/white refresh cycles with a delay between
 *              each cycle. When the cleaning is complete, a confirmation message is
 *              shown on the display.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Board:      Soldered Inkplate 4TEMPERA
 * - Framework:  ESP-IDF v6.x
 * - Hardware:   Inkplate 4TEMPERA, USB cable
 * - Extra:      None
 *
 * Configuration:
 * - Menuconfig -> Inkplate Boards -> Inkplate4
 *
 * How to use:
 * 1) Build and flash to Inkplate 4TEMPERA.
 * 2) The cleaning sequence runs automatically (20 cycles by default).
 * 3) "Clearing done." is shown when complete.
 *
 * Expected output:
 * - The screen flashes black and white 20 times, then shows "Clearing done."
 *
 * Notes:
 * - CYCLES_DELAY should not be set below 5000 ms between cycles.
 * - Increase CLEAR_CYCLES for more severe ghosting.
