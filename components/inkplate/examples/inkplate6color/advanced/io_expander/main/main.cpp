 * @file        main.cpp
 * @author      Fran Fodor for Soldered
 * @brief       IO expander GPIO blink example for Soldered Inkplate 6Color.
 *
 * @details     Demonstrates controlling an external GPIO through the on-board
 *              PCAL IO expander. Pin P1-7 (GPB7) is configured as an output
 *              and toggled five times with 500 ms intervals, then pauses for
 *              2 seconds before repeating. An LED (or other load) connected
 *              to that pin will blink accordingly.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Board:      Soldered Inkplate 6Color
 * - Framework:  ESP-IDF v6.x
 * - Hardware:   Inkplate 6Color, USB cable
 * - Extra:      LED or other load connected to IO expander pin GPB7
 *
 * Configuration:
 * - Menuconfig -> Inkplate Boards -> Inkplate6Color
 *
 * How to use:
 * 1) Connect an LED (with a resistor) to IO expander pin GPB7.
 * 2) Build and flash to Inkplate 6Color.
 * 3) The LED blinks five times, pauses, then repeats indefinitely.
 *
 * Expected output:
 * - LED on GPB7 blinks five times with 500 ms on/off, then a 2-second pause.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - expander1 is the internal IO expander declared as an extern in Inkplate.h.
